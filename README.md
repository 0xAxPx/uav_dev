## ⚠️ Safety Considerations

Even in simulation, developing good safety habits is crucial:

- Always understand what code does before executing
- Implement emergency stop/kill switch mechanisms
- Test in simulation extensively before hardware
- Follow local drone regulations and laws
- Never fly near people, airports, or restricted areas
- Maintain visual line of sight (VLOS) when flying real hardware
- Keep batteries and equipment in good condition
